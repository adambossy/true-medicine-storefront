# Getting Started

If you're on Mac OS, use Command + Space to bring up Spotlight. Type "Terminal" and hit enter to load the Terminal app. This assumes you have `git` over ssh and `npm` installed.

Once in the Terminal, type:

`git clone git@github.com:adambossy/true-medicine-storefront.git`

This will create a project directory called `true-medicine-storefront` with the project contents. To navigate to this project directory, type: 

`cd true-medicine-storefront`

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
